# fakeQuery
fakeQuery is a lightweight jQuery-like DOM manipulation module written by me to make life nicer. 

### Why not just use jQuery?
This is not to keep filesize/overhead low. 
It's part of a school assignment that required us to do a lot of DOM manipulation, **only vanilla JS allowed**. 

>So I wrote this little DOM manipulation tool like in the good ol' jQuery days.

### Cross-browser?
I would not use this on any other browsers than the ones that actually count (you know what I mean). The year is 2019 and this has not been used on anything else than Chrome v77.0.3865.120

### Free to use
Go ahead and modify, extend or do whatever you please to this bad boy! I might update it as time goes and I use it for small front-end projects. Hope it comes to use for someone else :)

>No further documentation as most methods work just like jQuery did. Should you have any questions, please refer to the code.
